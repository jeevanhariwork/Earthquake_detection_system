🌍 Earthquake Detection & Seismic Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on seismic data analysis using multiple datasets (FAS, SA, SD) to detect earthquake patterns and perform feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and can be easily executed on Google Colab.

The goal is to understand seismic signals better and explore data-driven approaches for earthquake detection and characterization.

📂 Datasets

The project uses three seismic datasets:

FAS → Fourier Amplitude Spectrum dataset

SA → Spectral Acceleration dataset

SD → Spectral Displacement dataset

These datasets are uploaded manually in Google Colab during execution.
